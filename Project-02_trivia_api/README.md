# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a  webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game. 

## About the Stack

We started the full stack application for you. It is desiged with some key functional areas:

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server. 
You will find further information in [`./backend/`](./backend/README.md).

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.
